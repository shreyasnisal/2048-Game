This repository contains the code for the 2048 game, developed with React Native and intended to be a windows native application. The respository corresponds to my [YouTube playlist on developing the 2048 game using React Native windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXg7wJRstoE&list=PLImMVrOC3KFl3AGLNp_u8V0yLeDCpMfgh). Please refer to the YouTube series for instructions on setting up your own project and developing the game.
